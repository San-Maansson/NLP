## Natural Language Processing with spaCy (+ pre-trained English language model)

A quick excercise on how to process a short text from Wikipedia using a pre-trained English language model to break down the text into individual sentences and words. (Tokenization)
We then use functions in spaCy to do Part of Speech (POS) tagging and Syntactic Dependency parsing and visualize it. 
A feature called Named Entity Recognition is also added and labelled.
